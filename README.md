When you're done, cut a branch and send me a pull request! https://github.com/sshepard/TestMe_NG

If you can't because you are against pulls or are all out of forks, then you can hand-write your answers on a dead tree and
shove them in an envelope (or email) to your technical contact, manager or recruiter person.
