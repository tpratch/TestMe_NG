* Look for instructions in index.html
* Fork me from: https://github.com/sshepard/TestMe_NG
* For the non-AngularJS version of the test go to https://github.com/sshepard/TestMe_lite

extra credit:
* Mock a "good" or "bad" reply from the server.
* Make another column that lists the checkboxes as you select them (this kind of thing is helpful when there's a long list of checkboxes).
* Use LESS/SASS, etc
* Deploy the project with Grunt to a .tgz
* Serve/Deploy with Yeoman.
* Create a NodeJS server with a reverse proxy and an app server that serves up the checkboxes in JSON format with data supplied by Solr.
* Serve with NodeJS or PHP or LAMP or ?
* Improve the Docs.
* Tell us how to improve the test or specific parts of the test.
* WOW us with your 1337 skilz.
